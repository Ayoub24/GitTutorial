HEAD is a pointer on the branch or the commit you want to work with.

By CHECKOUT command you can select a branch 

Every time you finish working on a branch you merge it with the master 

to create a branch 

git branch branchName
git checkout branchName

OR:
git checkout -b branchName

To See the merged branches:
git branch --merged

To See the non merged branches:
git branch --no-merged

To merge a branch:
git merge branchName

After merging a branch you need to delete it:
git branch -d branchName

If you want to delete a non merged branch:
git branch -D branchName

To delete a branch from the repository:
git push ayb :b2*
